# Knowledge Work Protocol

Protocols for idea capture, research documentation, and theme identification.

---

## Idea Capture Protocol

### Trigger
User says "I have an idea about..." or similar.

### Capture Workflow

1. **Initial capture**: Note the idea as stated
2. **Clarifying questions**: 
   - What sparked this idea?
   - How does it connect to current work?
   - What would it look like in practice?
3. **Explore implications**: Discuss applications and extensions
4. **Identify core theme**: What's the essential insight?
5. **Document**: Add to Ideas and Interests page
6. **Connect**: Suggest links to active projects

### Documentation Format

```markdown
## [Idea Title]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Sparked by**: [Context]

### The Idea
[Clear statement of the insight]

### Implications
[What this means, why it matters]

### Connections
- [Related project 1]
- [Related theme]
- [Potential applications]

### Status
[New / Exploring / Integrated / Archived]
```

### Ideas Worth Documenting
- Novel connections between disparate topics
- Reframings that clarify existing problems
- Potential solutions to active challenges
- Observations that might become themes

## Research Documentation

### When Reading Papers/Books

1. **Capture metadata**: Title, author, date, source
2. **Note key claims**: Main arguments or findings
3. **Extract quotes**: Significant passages (with page numbers)
4. **Personal response**: Reactions, questions, connections
5. **Project relevance**: Which projects does this inform?

### Research Note Format

```markdown
## [Title]
**Author**: [Name]
**Date Read**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Source**: [Link or location]

### Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

### Key Points
- [Main argument 1]
- [Main argument 2]
- [Significant finding]

### Notable Quotes
> "[Quote]" (p. XX)

### Connections
- Relates to [Project/Theme]
- Challenges/supports [existing idea]

### Questions Raised
- [Question for further exploration]
```

### Research Library Organization

Hierarchical by project area:
```
Research Library/
  ├── [Project Area 1]/
  │   ├── [Subtopic A]/
  │   └── [Subtopic B]/
  ├── [Project Area 2]/
  └── Cross-Reference Index
```

## Theme Identification

### What Are Themes?
Recurring intellectual patterns that appear across multiple projects. They represent deeper commitments or interests that unify seemingly disparate work.

### Theme Recognition Signs
- Same concept appearing in different projects
- Repeated use of particular frameworks
- Consistent critiques or positions
- Analogies that keep proving useful

### Documenting Themes

In Recurring Themes page:
```markdown
## [Theme Name]

### Description
[What this theme is about]

### Manifestations
- In [Project 1]: [How it appears]
- In [Project 2]: [How it appears]
- In [Ideas]: [Related ideas]

### Key Frameworks
[Associated mental models or frameworks]

### Evolution
[How understanding of this theme has developed]
```

### Theme Maintenance
- Review quarterly
- Add new manifestations as discovered
- Note when themes merge or split
- Archive themes that no longer apply

---

## Cross-Project Synthesis

### When to Synthesize
- Working on one project reveals insight relevant to another
- Research applies to multiple active projects
- Theme appears in new context

### Synthesis Protocol

1. **Note the connection**: Document where insight originated
2. **Trace implications**: What does this mean for each project?
3. **Update relevant pages**: Add cross-references
4. **Update themes**: If connection reveals deeper pattern

### Documentation
- Add to Ideas and Interests if novel
- Update project pages with cross-references
- Note in session summary

## Knowledge Work Session Flow

### Deep Work Session

1. **Load context**: Fetch project page and related materials
2. **Review state**: What was the last work? What's next?
3. **Set intention**: What will this session accomplish?
4. **Work**: Focus on the substantive task
5. **Capture**: Document insights as they emerge
6. **Update**: Refresh project page with progress

### Research Session

1. **Identify sources**: What needs to be read/reviewed?
2. **Active reading**: Engage with material, take notes
3. **Synthesize**: How does this connect to existing work?
4. **Document**: Update Research Library
5. **Propagate**: Update relevant project pages

### Exploration Session

1. **Start with question**: What are we exploring?
2. **Follow threads**: Let curiosity guide
3. **Capture ideas**: Document as they emerge
4. **Identify themes**: What patterns appear?
5. **Connect**: Link to existing work
