# 📋 Knowledge Work

Protocols for research, idea capture, and cross-project synthesis. Load when doing intellectual/creative work.

## Idea Capture Protocol

**When user says "I have an idea":**

1. **Engage in conversation:**
    - Clarifying questions
    - Explore what sparked it
    - Discuss applications
    - Identify core theme

2. **Document in Ideas and Interests:**
    - Essence of the idea
    - Category
    - Connections to projects/other ideas
    - Status

3. **Look for patterns:**
    - Relation to other ideas
    - Connection to existing projects
    - New interest area emerging
    - Combination potential

4. **Suggest next steps** if appropriate

**Periodic Review (First week of each month):**

During the weekly session summary audit, if it's the first week of the month, also review Ideas and Interests for:
- Ideas that have matured or gained new connections since capture
- Ideas ready to develop into project work
- Patterns across recent ideas suggesting new themes

This is checked as part of the weekly audit trigger — not a separate mechanism.

## Research Note Protocol

**Cross-referencing:** Track which papers/books uploaded to which projects

**Reminder:** If paper referenced but not uploaded where needed, remind user

**Library Tracking:** Research Library with cross-reference index showing availability

**Master Bibliography Maintenance:**
- ALWAYS maintain alphabetical order by author surname, then date, then title
- Insert new entries in correct position
- This is the single source of truth for bibliographic information

## Project Context Recognition Protocol

**When writing a running summary entry, tag it with a project context** (e.g., "Project: Research Paper" or "Project: PWKM"). If consecutive entries are tagged with the same project and the project page hasn't been fetched, suggest: "I notice we've been working on [Project] for a while — should I fetch the project page for context?"

Let the user decide:
- Yes → fetch project page
- No → continue as-is
- "Let's switch to project chat"

This piggybacks on the running summary mechanism rather than requiring independent time-tracking. The Specialized Input Recognition table in Core Protocols also catches explicit project work at input time.

## Memory Base Loading Protocol

**Loading context for project work:**

1. Fetch Memory Base for comprehensive background
2. Fetch specific project page for current details
3. Identify which Memory Base aspects are most relevant
4. Cross-reference with Research Library, Themes as needed

**When to update Memory Base:**
- Major project milestones
- New recurring themes identified
- Significant frameworks emerge
- Working methods evolve
- New tools adopted

## Session Summary Import Protocol

**When user imports summary to PWKM or summary created within PWKM:**

1. Review for content/themes → Update Recurring Themes if needed
2. Check Ideas document for relevant connections
3. Highlight relevant ideas to user
4. Update cross-references in Ideas if new ones identified
5. Update Work Patterns with session data
